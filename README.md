# PhishingURLDetection
This project aims to detect phishing URLs using machine learning techniques. Phishing is a fraudulent attempt to obtain sensitive information by disguising as a trustworthy entity in electronic communications. This project leverages Python and various machine learning algorithms to identify and classify phishing URLs.

## Key Features
Data Collection: Gather a dataset of URLs labeled as phishing or legitimate.
Feature Extraction: Extract relevant features from URLs, such as length, presence of special characters, and domain age.
Model Training: Train machine learning models like Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines to classify URLs.
Evaluation: Evaluate the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Deployment: Implement the trained model in both desktop and web applications.

## Implementation
Desktop Application: A Python Tkinter-based application for detecting phishing URLs.
Web Application: A CGI-based web application for real-time phishing URL detection.

## Demo and Documentation
A demo video and documentation is included to explain and showcase the functionality and usage of both the desktop and web applications.
